# Plant_Disease_Classification

We offer a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution to effectively tackle plant diseases, empowering farmers and enhancing agricultural productivity. Our cutting-edge technology leverages advanced AI and machine learning to provide accurate disease detection and timely intervention, significantly reducing crop losses. By promoting sustainable farming practices, our solution minimizes the use of chemicals, benefiting both the environment and crop health. Our comprehensive approach includes an intuitive mobile application, real-time monitoring capabilities, and continuous expert support. This ensures that users have the essential tools, knowledge, and resources they need to protect their crops, maximize yields, and achieve long-term agricultural success.

We have used following modules

TensorFlow/Keras: Frameworks used for building and training the CNN model.
OpenCV: Library used for image processing tasks.
NumPy & Pandas: Libraries for numerical computations and data manipulation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
